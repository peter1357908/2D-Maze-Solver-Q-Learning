# Q-learning Solver for Simple 2D Maze

## Dependent Libraries

PyGame 2.0.0, NumPy 1.19.4

## How to Run

Make sure you have installed all the dependent libraries, then simply run `python ./2D_maze_Q_learning.py` in the root directory of this project.

## Algorithm

A simple Q-learning algorithm is used to help the agent train itself and ultimately solve a given maze. The trained agent can only solve the maze it is trained on; it has train itself again for each new maze.

## Implementation



## Resources Used

Took reference from [my own past implementation of q-learning](https://github.com/peter1357908/RL-Solvers/blob/master/MountainCar-v0_Q-table_Analyzed.py) as well as [this web article on using q-learning to solve 2D mazes](https://becominghuman.ai/q-learning-a-maneuver-of-mazes-885137e957e4).

## Data Used


## Result and Observation
Could have randomized q-table

## Conclusion

Did it work? Why? How might it be improved? Would it extend to other data?
